<h1>Virtual Active Directory for Bulk User Creation Home Lab</h1>

<h2>Project Objective:</h2>

To establish a robust and scalable virtual Active Directory (AD) infrastructure, automating user provisioning, maintenance, and deprovisioning processes while ensuring secure remote access and efficient file server management.
<br />

<h2>Key Deliverables:</h2>

<b>1. Automated User Provisioning and Management:</b>

- Develop and implement PowerShell scripts to streamline the creation, modification, and deletion of user accounts in bulk.
- Configure automated workflows to synchronize user information with other systems (e.g., HR, ERP) to maintain accurate and up-to-date records.

<b>2. Remote Access Server (RAS) Configuration:</b>

- Deploy and configure RAS services to enable secure remote access for authorized users via VPN or DirectAccess.
- Implement Network Address Translation (NAT) and Port Address Translation (PAT) to optimize network resources and enhance security.
- Configure authentication mechanisms (e.g., smart cards, multi-factor authentication) to strengthen access controls.

<b>3. Windows DNS and DHCP Services:</b>

- Install and configure Windows DNS to provide reliable name resolution for devices and services within the network.
- Implement DNS zones and records to manage domain name resolution and DNS security.
- Install and configure Windows DHCP to automatically assign IP addresses to network devices, ensuring efficient IP address management.
- Configure DHCP scope options to provide necessary network configuration information to clients.

<b>4. Windows File Server Configuration:</b>

- Deploy and configure Windows File Servers to store and share files securely.
- Implement NTFS permissions to control access to files and folders, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.
- Configure file server quotas to manage storage usage and prevent resource exhaustion.
- Implement backup and recovery strategies to protect critical data.

<b>Expected Outcomes</b>

- <b>Enhanced Efficiency:</b> Automated user provisioning and management will reduce manual effort and minimize errors.
- <b>Improved Security:</b> Secure remote access and robust authentication mechanisms will protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
- <b>Reliable Network Services:</b> Reliable DNS and DHCP services will ensure seamless network operations and efficient IP address management.
- <b>Effective File Server Management:</b> Well-configured file servers with appropriate permissions and quotas will optimize storage utilization and data security.
